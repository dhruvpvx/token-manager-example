# Advanced JWT Session Management in React Native

This repository serves as a practical example of implementing advanced JWT (JSON Web Token) session management in a React Native application. It demonstrates a clean and efficient approach to handling authentication, token storage, and API requests using JWT.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. To showcase a robust token management system using access and refresh tokens.
2. To demonstrate how to implement API request interceptors for automatic token handling.
3. To provide a reusable and maintainable code structure for JWT authentication in React Native apps.

## Key Features

- Secure token storage using AsyncStorage
- Automatic access token refresh using interceptors
- Proper handling of token expiration and user logout
- Clean separation of concerns with utility classes for token and storage management
